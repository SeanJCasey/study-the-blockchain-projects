Final project notes

dummy values:

BNB: 0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52
1hr: 3600


- consider using deposited ETH + ERC20 tokens held in contract as "pool liquidity" to make money while waiting for conversion [OR, use for lending via MKR!!]


Pavan researching:

    - when to include in struct and when to use mappings

    ME: what does NOW return in a call()


Further Q's:

    - If I want to allow users to use either ETH or DAI...
        - should I just use 2 separate forms (1 for ETH to ERC20 and 1 for DAI to ETH+ERC20)?


NOTES:

- Need to follow these instructions to compile Uniswap's Vyper contracts: https://github.com/Uniswap/contracts-vyper
